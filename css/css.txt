Syntax for CSS

Example:- p{color: blue}

here "p" is the selector 
color is the property
and blue is the value 

Selectors for class start with ".". Example ".hi"
And for ID starts with "#". Example: "#hi"

For multi-selecting

Example: header,p.start{
    background-color:red;
    border-radius: 3px
}

Here "header, p.start" is the group of Selectors
And "{
    background-color:red;
    border-radius: 3px
}" is the Declaration Block


The three ways to add CSS to the HTML are:-
1. Inline CSS: CSS is added to the elements directly  using style attribute

2. Internal CSS: CSS is kept inside the head tags in  <style> tags

3. External CSS: CSS is kept separately inside a ".css" style sheet
