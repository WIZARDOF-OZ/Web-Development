Syntax for CSS

Example:- p{color: blue}

color is the property
and blue is the value 

Selectors for class start with ".". Example ".hi"
And for ID starts with "#". Example: "#hi"

For multi-selecting

Example: header,p.start{
    background-color:red;
    border-radius: 3px
}

Here "header, p.start" is the group of Selectors
And "{
    background-color:red;
    border-radius: 3px
}" is the Declaration Block
